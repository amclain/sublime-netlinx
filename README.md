# Sublime Text AMX NetLinx Plugin

sublime-netlinx

This is a plugin for developers looking for a lighter weight alternative to NetLinx Studio, while still providing powerful functionality. On top of the features provided by [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), this plugin adds syntax highlighting, color schemes, and build support for the AMX NetLinx programming language. This is also a great option for programmers who are looking to use one editor for multiple languages.

***Designed for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)***
