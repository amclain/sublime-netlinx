Installing Via Version Control
==============================
On the Sublime menu bar, go to `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages`. This will
open a file browser at your Sublime user packages directory.

Mercurial (Hg)
--------------
```text
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/amclain/sublime-netlinx
```

Using [TortoiseHg](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/) or the [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)
`hg` command, [clone](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/manual/2.9/clone.html)
the [sublime-netlinx project source code](https://bitbucket.org/amclain/sublime-netlinx)
into the Sublime packages directory under a folder named ***NetLinx***.

The plugin is now installed and will show up in Sublime Text. At this point you
can optionally use Mercurial to switch to a specific version of the plugin.
Updating is as simple as using the Mercurial ***pull*** command.

Git
---
```text
git clone https://github.com/amclain/sublime-netlinx.git
```
